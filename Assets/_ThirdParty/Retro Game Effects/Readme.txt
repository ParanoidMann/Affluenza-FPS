Retro Game Effects is a set of shader effects emulating retro game rendering.

CRT:
- Possible configurations are practically endless because it has over 25 material parameters to tweak.
  For head start it comes with 5 predefined CRT models.
  A professional crt display effect solution.

VHS:
- Blur replicates the look of old, deteriorated VHS recordings.
  "Amount" controls how much to blur the image overall, while "R Channel Offset" controls the difference in blurring separate channels, introducing an softer chromatic aberration.
- CRT simulates a CRT display by dividing the image into very small red, green, and blue bars, separated by tiny empty spaces. You can regulate the size of those bars with a slider.
  Likely, you won't use the effect with main camera, but it could look interesting when you apply it to an in-game television screen, adding some extra authenticity.
- TV Distortion combines several effects into one, replicating defects of old CRT television sets.
  "Distortion" controls the strength of the vertical and horizontal distortion of the whole image.
  "Fisheye" applies a fisheye-lens-like deformation to the image.
  "Stripes" controls visibility of noisy horizontal stripes.
  "Noise" adds a filter of static across the whole image.
  "Vignette" darkens the corners of the screen.
  Effect can have a custom noise texture applied, an example texture that looks good is included.

Dither:
- A dither shader with many dither pattern textures and color palette textures.

PlayStation1
- Simulate playstation one shading.

OldFilm
- Simulate old film with filter shader.
